Here's the translation into English:

"FROGGER" --> GHOST 'N GOBLINS

As an initial project, a "Frogger" was proposed, a classic old game where a frog has to cross a road. However, I decided to make another one (with the professor's permission), but to honor the other game, I kept that name for the main file.

Ghost 'n Goblins is a classic game from 1985. The objective of the game is to rescue Princess "Prin Prin" who has been kidnapped by Astaroth and is under his guard. From now on, you will be Arthur, a brave knight.

During the game, you will have to survive a total of 5 levels and progress through them. In each level, the objective is to collect all the "keys" to open the door.

At level 1 ("Cemetery in the Forest") you will face Zombies, Jumpers, Woodies, and Shield Bearers, in order to obtain the only clover (which we trust will bring you luck to save Prin Prin) that will open the first door.

Once at level 2 ("Frozen World") you will face the small ("Bats") and even more dangerous Petites to obtain the 5 potions that will give you enough energy to finish the remaining levels.

When you pass through the Frozen Gate, you will reach level 3 ("Goblin Town"), the old city of Astaroth where the large "Goblins", along with the terrifying "MayGly" and the persistent Jumpers, await to end you. Grab the 4 keys to guess which of the two doors will take you to...

level 4 ("Underground Passage under Astaroth's Castle"), a sub-world level, where you will face the swift "Death", the bat-winged "Bat" to gather money to pay the castle guards and gain entry.

Finally, if you manage to get to level 5, we will have arrived at ("Astaroth's Castle"). But there's a twist! After spending all the gold and silver coins from level 4, the guards ("Pigs") have betrayed you and return to defend Astaroth. Survive the Pigs guarding Astaroth and the last door. As expected, the castle has aerial surveillance, so beware of the "Reds" who are the fastest!!

Once you manage to steal the 3 bouquets of flowers from Astaroth's garden, you can rescue the princess!! Save the last armor to greet her in the best possible way!

I forgot!! Change your weapon as many times as you want! During the different levels, you will find new weapons (you can see their characteristics in the initial instructions) but be careful, because not all that glitters is gold (some have different movement).

Good luck!
